# Pictures
If you have previously created a folder with images that you wish to use in your README file, 
then for displaying such images, you must specify the relative address of your file in the repository, 
for example, in my the media folder contains an image called super.jfif, to display you need to enter

![](./media/super.jfif)

Image link
Everything works exactly the same combination of exclamation point + square brackets + parentheses

# Link to external URL
We can just add a link from the browser https://github.com/BEPb and it will work, 
but if we want to hide it after the text, 
the link must be placed in parentheses, 
and the text in square brackets immediately before the link

# Link to text inside README.md

If we form a link inside the README.md file, 
then we should remember that we can only refer to headers, See "Heading" section

[See "Heading" section](#Heading)
But what if the title consists of several words?... 
You need to replace all spaces with '-' as a section about Horizontal line

[Horizontal line](#Horizontal-line)

# Line wrapping
Perhaps this is not usual and not familiar, but when you press the "Enter" button, 
your text will still be displayed in one line, and in order for your transfer to work, 
you need to add two spaces at the end of the line

Or just add an empty string, i.e. press "Enter" 2 times. 
In this case, the transfer effect will be achieved, but line spacing will be larger.

# Text selection

The above examples will not be able to keep the indentation of complex text on each line, 
for this purpose use in three backticks "```", 
and they must be on separate lines before and after the text, respectively.

If you only use a pair of backticks, then your text will be highlighted, but not indented. 
Same way you can highlight individual words in the text.


Logic can take you from point A to point B, and imagination can take you anywhere. (Albert Einstein)

But that's not all, often we feel the need to place code fragments, it is desirable not only to keep indents, 
but also highlight with color, for this you need to specify the programming language after the first three quotes

# One line of text

text on one line
Add 4 spaces at the beginning of the line and your text will be highlighted in a separate window, as in the example. 
Sometimes it works on tab, but not always.... the tab character is sometimes indented by 3 or more spaces.

# Multiline text

Add 4 spaces at the beginning of each line and your text will be highlighted in a separate window, as in the example.

# Heading 1 (another way)
A first level heading can also be created with one or more '=' characters placed on line following the title:

Heading 1
=


# Heading 2 (another way)
A second level heading can also be created with one or more '-' characters placed on line following the title:

Heading 2
-

# Horizontal line

A horizontal line (separating line) can be obtained in three ways:

*** (using three consecutive '*' (asterisk))、
--- (using three consecutive '-' (dash))、
___ (using three consecutive '_' characters (underscore))
they all display the horizontal line effect
